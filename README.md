Convert string (like 'Hello World') to binary, and create analog data as ndarray.<br>
The ndarray is processed using gaussian / buterworth filter.<br>
Filtered ndarray is again converted to binary.<br>
The binary is again converted to string.<br>
Compare the two strings, and judge if transmission was successful or not.<br>
